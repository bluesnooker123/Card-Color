('STAGE 0','STAGE 0 / - CLEAR LIGHT (“ALL”NESS / NOTHINGNESS- UNITY)','What’s at the core – DNA? Transpersonal, Transcendent. Original organizing life force. Programming one comes in with. Extremes: container for everything. What’s at the core? One’s basic foundation is found here. It\'s the DNA or programming one came in with. Spirituality is very important. May signify deep spiritual or mystical states. May also feel detached or disembodied, have poor sense of boundaries, or want to take over. This is a transpersonal place of extremes, good/evil either/or etc., a place where the first grief of separation is still felt. One may have a deep nostalgia to return to spirit. On the negative side one may be experiencing a transpersonal crisis of faith, no hope or “God is Dead” feelings. Returning to this place when it is not regularly chosen can mean the potential for re-creation of self. '),
('STAGE 1','STAGE 1: THE ENTRY (THE DESCENT INTO MATTER)','The Void  is a viewpoint that is first developed during the intrauterine experience prior to birth. There is no sense of individual will here. Time seems to stand still in an eternal now. You may experience physical sensations of pressure, heaviness, or claustrophobia that could recall your birth experience. The stage can be triggered later in life as the aftermath of sweeping changes to your sense of who you are. It may also follow extreme physical challenges and profound spiritual experiences. In Stage 1, the Void, your ego is closely aligned with the Self in a covert, paradoxical relationship called negative inflation. This gives you an exaggerated sense of yourself as small, powerless, and acted on by external forces (victim). This is a stage when your ego does not function well, and you need to be patient with yourself and put your trust in tried and true instincts to see you through. In terms of spiritual experience, this stage is comparable to the mystic’s intense absorption in deep inner states of not-thingness. Aspects of physical embodiment and gravity. Close to the earth and the deep unconscious. Might feel like you don’t fit into the world. Loneliness. #BoldStart#If all the other cards are at ending stages, this might be a BEGINNING AGAIN / REBIRTH or RE-ENTRY (perhaps into the mystery school).#BoldEnd# The heaviness of physical embodiment in a different way; as in a burden of “mission” and/or message. Beginning again in a whole new way. Feel like you don’t fit into the world may be that the world doesn\'t understand your work or the consciousness of the interconnectedness and complexity of life; assent to process.'),
('STAGE 2','STAGE 2: BLISS/MULTIPLICITY (FORMING WITHOUT KNOWING)','No boundaries. Information comes in through dreams, intuition, sensing, or \"sleeping on it.\" Growth in multiple forms. Receptivity / Regeneration / Recovery. Bliss occurs following birth when, if all goes well, you are cuddled, fed, and cared for in ways that make the world seem a safe and welcoming place, A pleasant lack of ego boundaries characterizes Bliss, even when experienced later in life. This stage is accompanied by deep relaxation. The state of mind is dreamy, drowsy. It has been found that creative persons return to this stage often between periods of productivity, to rest and receive inspiration from the unconscious. Mystics swim in this state of mind as in an ocean of love. '),
('STAGE 3','STAGE 3: LABYRINTH (MOVEMENT OF ENERGY /FINDING ONE’S PATH)','Neurological connections between mind and body. Feelings and images predominate. A beginning trust in the process. Consciousness is activated. Labyrinth is developed during an infant’s exploration of its body and its surroundings. During the stage of the Labyrinth, an infant experiments with sensing and movement and begins to organize its findings into a map of reality. When experienced later in life, this stage brings flexibility and openness to new information that can be beneficial for healing physical and psychological injuries. Some spiritual practices cultivate this state of consciousness for communicating with the ancestors, for contacting animal spirit guides, or for other shamanic practices. Active searching and exploring, even though not goal directed, gives this stage a characteristically energetic quality.'),
('STAGE 4','STAGE 4: BEGINNINGS (READINESS TO START)','Basic needs and support. Passivity and dependency. New #BoldStart#Beginnings - opened prior to the age of two, when baby and mother enjoy the ultimate experience of mutual bonding. Mother /child relationships. When is needs are met and its mother takes pleasure in mother love, a baby feels content and trusting. Ever after, this stage is characterized by a pleasant sense of containing and nurturing creative energy, though just what will develop is not al all clear. On a spiritual level, this stage is about feeling compassion for others and serving from heart-felt caring.#BoldEnd# '),
('STAGE 5','STAGE 5: THE TARGET (FOCUS AND DEFENSE)','Learning HOW:  patterns , rules and rhythms. Protect self and build boundaries; concern with what is sacred, what is profane. Learning to focus and discriminate, but with intensity. The first assertion of the self as ego; concern with self-preservation and defense.\\nTarget is established with the baby’s intense experience of leaving the womb. It is further developed during the toddler’s discovery of itself as a separate person. Around age two, you begin to actively go after what you want instead of passively waiting for it to be provided, and this creates inevitable conflicts with caregivers. When you do not get what you want, you become frustrated. Not getting your way can even lead to a feeling of being victimized. During Stage 5, Target, behaviors for self-soothing and protection arise as a normal reaction to feelings of disappointment and vulnerability. These behaviors further define your psychological separateness from others and act to reinforce you ego. Later in life, ritualized behaviors for self-care and self-protection may be elaborated as reassurance that your ego boundaries are adequate. The target state of mind can be triggered when you feel tired or vulnerable, or when you encounter unexpected resistance from others. On a spiritual level, this stage may bring an appreciation for religious rituals, as well as a realization of the limits imposed by your ego. Considering the possibility of transcending these limits may also occur.'),
('STAGE 6','STAGE 6: STRUGGLE (THE DRAGON FIGHT)','Breaking free of parental dictates and beginning a quest for individuation. Establishment and expression of ego boundaries. “Dragon Fight” and “slaying of the parents” – surpassing of the mother (holds child fast) and father (values and tradition). #BoldStart#The tension of the opposites#BoldEnd# –and the wholeness gained by confronting each. Dragon Fight has to do with adolescent conflicts that accomplish your separation from your parents, and from the tribe or community in which you grew up. At this stage, you may break out of hidebound traditions in general. Dragon Fight is characterized by an increase of tension at all levels of the psyche. Issues are polarized and may be acted out in emotional confrontations with others. All this conflict creates greater and greater energy until finally enough energy is available to generate a new psychological perspective. The new viewpoint resolves the conflicts between your ego and traditional sources of control into a new synthesis that fully incorporates both sides of the conflict. Important transitions later in life—times such as midlife—can bring you around again to the stage of Dragon Fight. On a spiritual level, this stage is concerned with confronting self-doubt, facing the temptations to misuse power, and working through the contradictions between religious dogma and your own spiritual experience.'),
('STAGE 7','STAGE 7: SQUARING THE CIRCLE (FULL CONSCIOUSNESS)','Self (Ego) is fully evident and expressed. Assumption of autonomy and responsibility. Linearity and form enter the realm of wholeness. The expectations of the world are addressed: i.e., enough money, degrees, etc. Squaring the Circle is opened when you can function independently and go to school. It is fully developed in young adulthood when you have completed your education and have the potential to create, but as yet you have accomplished little. Intellectual ability is heightened here. This is a time when you are filled with a sense of power, importance and mission. Your ego is synchronized with the deeper order of the Self and you receive an injection of energy because of this. To use the energy appropriately, you choose goals that will accomplish more than simple fulfillment of ego desires for wealth, health, and happiness. You find projects worthy of your best efforts, projects that challenge you to grow, create, and care for others. Later in life, completing some kind of training, formal or informal, can bring you to an experience of Squaring the Circle. On a spiritual level, this stage is about dedicating yourself to principles and practices that enhance life for you and others.'),
('STAGE 8','STAGE 8: FUNCTIONING EGO (THE SPECIALIST)','Full autonomy and will. Individuality and full identity. Mature / can be alone but not lonely\r\nCareer issues. Functioning Ego opens during those moments of generative adult life when you are actively engaged in bringing your ideas and inspirations into reality. You are busy doing, no longer just being. During this stage you are comfortable working within groups or organizations in order to accomplish your personal goals. Conversely, you have the ability to feel comfortable by yourself and to work without supervision to accomplish the goals you believe in. The state of mind of Functioning Ego can be triggered as you become engrossed in accomplishing a challenging task, such as remodeling your house, starting a business, or managing interpersonal issues as a community leader. This stage can be activated as you take inititative to bring an inspiration into reality. On a spiritual level, this stage is about finding ways of sharing your wisdom gently and respectfully with others in ways they can understand.\r\n'),
('STAGE 9','STAGE 9: SELF AND OTHERS (MANIFESTING / CRYSTALLIZATION)','Self and others /group identification/ professional peer respect. Socialization of self with others as a larger organism. Wants to bring things to completion, leave a mark or legacy; interest in mentorship. The sense of what one has and hasn’t accomplished. Crystallization reflects a time of fulfillment, satisfaction, and completion. This stage is opened by your adult experience of finishing a project or fulfilling an important commitment, such as raising a family. A slowing of creative activity and a sense of harmony, balance, and relaxed enjoyment characterize this stage. Crystallization is a sweet time, a moment of joy, and a pause for delight in the cycle of the Great Round. In later cycles, Crystallization is a time when you achieve mastery of a spiritual practice. You may apply your intellect to help you think through a knotty spiritual dilemma and feel a sense of achievement for having done so.'),
('STAGE 10','STAGE 10: ENDINGS (SHIFTS AND CHANGES)','Mid-life and a time to reassess goals; a time to sort through and jettison the non-essential. Crossroads or major transitional change. A gate - some see as a burden, others welcome it.\r\nFeeling separated and a sense of loss, an encounter with death. Gates of Death begins the natural process of ending the Great Round cycle, in preparation for a new beginning. The influence of the Self can be seen in experiences that open this stage. It often comes in losses or obstructions that challenge you and cause you to question who you think you are. You may find that things that were important no longer hold your interest. Sometimes an event, such as an illness, will forcefully shift you to this stage. In the unfolding of human life this stage coincides with late midlife, although it is experienced earlier at important turning points in the relationship between your ego and the Self. This stage can be a bittersweet parting with what was, or a painful rending from what can no longer be. Energy declines for outward things as more and more of it shifts inward into the unconscious. It is a time when you are asked to let go of life the way it was, but you have no sense of what is to come. You feel betwixt and between. You may begin to lose touch with the spirituality that has been an easy and comforting relationship with God.\r\n'),
('STAGE 11','STAGE 11: FRAGMENTATION (DISINTEGRATION)','The dark night of the soul. A time of creative chaos; crisis and opportunity. A stage of unanswerable questions- can be feeling victimized by “fate”. A time of fear, confusion and loss of meaning. Fragmentation continues the entropy begun in Gates of Death. This stage is about challenges to your body, and much more. What began as endings in the outer world continues here as a de-structuring of your ego to the point that you may feel like a stranger to yourself. This is all a necessary prelude to a major reorganization of your ego. For many this stage is profoundly disturbing, as they find their belief in the ultimate order of things challenged. It is not unusual to feel dizzy or nauseated when experiencing this stage.  Your understanding of the nature of reality may be changed by what you experience here in Fragmentation. It may seem you have completely lost contact with the Self, but the chaos experienced here is really orchestrated by the Self. The disorganization speeds the letting go that is necessary before your ego can be restructured in a stronger, more complex pattern in keeping with your potential for wholeness. The Spanish mystic Saint John of the Cross knew this stage well. He described it as the Dark Night of the Soul. This stage can bring you intense spiritual experiences. '),
('STAGE 12','STAGE 12: TRANSCENDENT ECSTASY (INTEGRATION)','Rebirth. Order out of chaos. Realignment with self /new potentials. Self –actualization. Transcendent Ecstasy reflects the blissful experience that follows the struggle of the previous stage. It comes as the result of embracing the limitations of the physical body and stepping beyond into a much larger dimension where spirit permeates and support everything In this stage, you experience the freedom of transcending beliefs that had become too narrow for you. It is the gift of old age and those rare moments of ecstasy earlier in life. You knowingly surrender your ego to the care of the Self, and you are rewarded with a glimpse of ultimate reality, an sense of the divine order and your rightful place within it. On a spiritual level, Stage 12, Transcendent Ecstasy, is a moment of understanding the divine through direct experience, rather than by intellect. This is a peak experience. It is a moment to be treasured as the essence of your circling the Great Round. Take it with you like a seed to be planted in the darkness for your next beginning Stage 1 – The Void. Specifically if card z, the bird like symbol is chosen, it can represent soaring with newness. Trust in whatever the future holds. Happiness and Freedom).'),
